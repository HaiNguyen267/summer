Your balance: $1000
Your food: 30
Choose a pet or action:
1. Cat
2. Dog
3. Hamster

food ($1 = 3 food), and use the food the feed the pet. Dog eats 5 food units each time,
cat eats 3, hamster and parrot eats 1

+) User can choose a pet to interact with, or buy more food. Each pet has its own
action list it can perform

+) Check the txt files of different pets to learn more. Or you can run the Main class as the example

+) After user feeds the pet, it will make its sound and program prints out "You fed the pet".
